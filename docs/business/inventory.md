# Inventory & Purchase

> Entry point: [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) · Tools: [../ai/tools.md](../ai/tools.md) · Data: `bms_inventory`, `bms_stock_movements`, `bms_purchase_orders` ([../architecture/database.md](../architecture/database.md))

Inventory is the source of truth. Never update stock directly — always go through the Inventory
Service (`lib/bms/stock.ts`, `lib/bms/movements.ts`).

```
Current Stock = Available Stock + Reserved Stock
Available Stock = Current Stock − Reserved Stock
```

Every stock change **must** generate a Stock Movement record. Never update inventory without
logging movement.

## Movement types (`bms_stock_movements.type`)

| Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `STOCK_IN` | Manual adjustment increase, or receiving a Purchase Order |
| `STOCK_OUT` | Manual adjustment decrease |
| `RESERVE` | Order created (reserve stock) |
| `RELEASE` | Order cancelled or auto-released (return reservation) |
| `SHIP` | Order shipped (permanent deduction: current −= qty, reserved −= qty) |
| `RETURN` | Goods returned (stock re-added) |

`TRANSFER` / `ADJUSTMENT` / `DAMAGED` are roadmap types — adjustments are currently recorded as
plain `STOCK_IN`/`STOCK_OUT`.

## Product rules

- SKU must be unique; barcode should be unique.
- Inactive products cannot be sold.
- Price cannot be negative; stock cannot go negative unless `AllowNegativeStock` is enabled.
- **Implemented product detail** (`bms_products`, migration `5.9`): `image_url` (upload via
  `/api/bms/products/upload`, ≤10MB, images only), `description`, `cost_price` (used to compute
  `price − cost_price` margin in the Products page — not yet rolled into Reports), free-text
  `category`/`brand` with autocomplete from prior values used in the shop.
- **Implemented product gallery** (`bms_product_images`, migration `6.5`): one product can now
  store multiple uploaded images in display order. `image_url` still acts as the primary cover
  image for backward compatibility; the current Products UI sends both `image_url` and
  `image_urls[]`.
- Categories are a managed list (`bms_product_categories`, migration `6.0`) that the shop can edit
  from a dropdown; renaming a category syncs to products referencing the old name in one
  transaction. Deleting a category does not delete products, only removes it from the dropdown.

## Purchase Orders (supplier replenishment)

**Implemented** (`bms_purchase_orders.status`):

```
OPEN → PARTIAL → RECEIVED
     ↘ CANCELLED
```

Receiving goods automatically increases inventory (`STOCK_IN` movement) and recalculates PO status
to `PARTIAL` or `RECEIVED` depending on how much of the ordered quantity has arrived. A cancelled PO
cannot receive further — and cancelling never claws back stock already received (standard inventory
accounting: what's received stays received).

Permissions: `purchase.view` / `purchase.edit` / `purchase.receive` / `purchase.cancel`.
